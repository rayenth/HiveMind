the overall idea here is that i used the observer design pattern
i have events, they are my data types "DTO" the objects i handle they are gotten form the publishers
then these publishers report these events to the kafkaforwarder service that will filter the events and choose what to
send to the kafka producer service, and the final step the kafkaproducer will do the actual sending of the data to
the kafka server.
