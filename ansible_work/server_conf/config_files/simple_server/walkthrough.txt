so here is what i did 
i made and ssh key pair without a passphrase  

$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 ansible


then installed the nano and the openssh-server on the container i propably should have edited that in the dockerfile of the containers but i am just lazy
$ ssh root@172.19.0.2


$ apt update
$ apt install nano 
$ apt intall openssh-server

start the service 

$ service ssh start

allow ssh in the ssh_config
$ nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config
and these lines:

PermitRootLogin yes
PasswordAuthentication yes


then restart the service 
$ service ssh restart


then log out and 

add the ssh key to the docker ubuntu containers 

$ ssh-copy-id -i /home/mr-cookie/ssh/ansible.pub root@172.19.0.2       // the ip address isn't really fixed so you have to figure it out every time you start the container and also you need to use the root or create a user on the container and use that as your user


then here run the ansible command this will ping all present devices in the 


$ ansible all --key-file /home/mr-cookie/.ssh/ansible -i inventory -m ping


all : all ip addresses listed in the inventory it can be replaces with :
* = all
!172.19.0.2 = all ips except this one
dhcp-server = ping the ips that are a group of the group dhcp-server


now this command is longer then it should be 
so we make a file we call it ansible.cfg 
and we write this to it

[defaults]
inventory = inventory (your inventory name)
private_key_file = ~/.ssh/ansible (your private key)










and this should end the simple ubuntu server part of the project XD
